# BetterMeter Main Dashboard.

UI components with react and MUI. LESTHAN 10hrs

## MUI usage

Not used mui grid system because the Figma UI is a custom design. It's not necessary to use mui grid. It will be complecated in future development :)

MUI componets is important for buttons, navbar, tabs, tables ect.
I did not use the tab component to make the tab view for now. it will take time to customize it.

### Error handling

I did not to do any. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
